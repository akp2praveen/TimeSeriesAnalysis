ABSTRACT 

In the dynamic retail landscape, startups grapple with challenges hindering sustained growth, compounded by market uncertainties and limited awareness. This abstract charts a pioneering course, focusing on the development and evaluation of tailored time series analysis models for predicting future sales. The study meticulously unpacks the creation and assessment of ARIMA, SARIMAX, and LSTM models, harnessing their forecasting process. The core ambition is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, providing a nuanced understanding of how accurate sales predictions can impact operational efficiency and strategic decision-making. With impressive accuracy rates of 95% for ARIMA, 94% for SARIMAX, and 95% for LSTM, the research extends beyond academic discourse, offering startup retailers tangible tools for navigating future sales predictions. By using ARIMA and SARIMAX, this research contributes not only to theoretical knowledge but also empowers startups with actionable insights. These models offer a glimpse into the future, enabling startups to navigate the complexities of the retail market with foresight. As startups face the dynamism of consumer behavior and market trends, these accuracy rates serve as a robust foundation for informed decision-making, enhancing the adaptability and competitiveness of startups in the ever-evolving retail sector.
